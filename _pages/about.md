I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of AI (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae) in Abu Dhabi. 
My research interests are in the areas of computer architecture, software system design, and machine learning,
with the goal of co-designing future ML systems for high performance, scalable reliability, and intelligent resources
allocation.

[//]: # (My work focuses on addressing the role hardware errors play on an application's error)
[//]: # (tolerance, by designing tools and techniques to help understand how)
[//]: # (hardware errors propagate and affect software.)

Before starting as a professor, I was a postdoc researcher in computer science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science), working
with Dr. David Brooks and Dr. Gu-Yeon Wei in the [Harvard Architecture, Circuits, and
Compilers Group](https://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu/). 
I completed my PhD at UIUC
under the guidance of [Dr. Sarita Adve](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/~sadve/) in 
the [RSim Research Group](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/). During my graduate studies, 
I was very fortunate to be the recipient of the 
[Mavis Future Faculty Fellowship](https://publish.illinois.edu/engr-mavis/), to be invited
to the [7th Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/), 
and to receive multiple awards for teaching and
mentoring undergraduate students. Prior to joining UIUC, I completed my BSE from
[Princeton University](https://ece.princeton.edu/), where I was the recipient of the 
John Ogden Bigelow Jr. Prize in Electrical Engineering. 

In addition to doing research, I am also a steering committee member for the 
Computer Architecture Student Association ([CASA](https://www.sigarch.org/casa/)) and the Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring
([CALM](https://www.comparchmentoring.org/)) initiatives. 
In my free time, I enjoy watching documentaries, playing soccer, and I am
a contributing feature article writer at [TechSpot.com](https://www.techspot.com/).
